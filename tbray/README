##  The idea to create this directory came from the MooseX-POE module.
##  What a great idea. :)

##  Back in 2007, Tim Bray created the wonderful Wide-Finder site. I came
##  across this site 2 months ago when searching for problems to solve using
##  MCE. At the time, MCE lacked the slurpio option. MCE wasn't fast enough
##  as seen with the first wf_mce1.pl example. Perl allows the possibility to
##  slurp an entire file into a scalar. All I needed was an if statement to
##  not convert the chunk to an array via the use_slurpio option.

##  It requires the data at https://www.tbray.org/tmp/o10k.ap
##  To create o1000k.ap, take o10k.ap and concatenate it 99 more times.
##
##  UNIX$ wget https://www.tbray.org/tmp/o10k.ap
##  UNIX$ for i in `seq 1 100`; do cat o10k.ap >> o1000k.ap; done

##  Scripts are normalized to use Time::HiRes for computing time to run.

tbray_baseline1.pl
      Baseline script for Perl.
      Regex optimization not working as expected.

tbray_baseline2.pl
      Regex optimization working as expected.

wf_mce1.pl
      By default, MCE passes a reference to an array containing
      the chunk data.

wf_mce2.pl
      Enabling slurpio causes MCE to pass the reference of the scalar
      containing the raw chunk data. Essentially, MCE does not convert
      the chunk to an array. That is the sole difference between
      slurpio => 1 and slurpio => 0 (default).

wf_mce3.pl
      Like wf_mce2.pl. Enable parallel IO.

wf_mmap.pl
      Code from Sean O'Rourke, 2007, public domain.
      Modified to default to 8 workers if -J is not specified.
      Modified to not use Sys::Mmap.

MCE is on the heals of MMAP IO performance levels. MCE performs sequential IO
(only a single worker reads at any given time). For MMAP IO, many workers are
reading simultaneously (essentially random IO), which is not noticeable when
reading from FS cache. MMAP IO is seen wanting nearly 3x the time when reading
directly from disk. That came as a surprise to me actually.

The result helps clarify a decision I made with MCE. Sequential IO is always
thought to be the fastest out there in various benchmark reviews (even SSDs).
Therefore, I designed MCE to follow a bank-teller queuing model when reading
input data.

##
##  Q. Why does MCE follow a bank-teller queuing model for input data?
##

The main reason was for maximizing on all available cores from start to end.
In essence, a core should begin to go idle towards the end of the job such
as reaching the EOF. A worker requiring 1.5x the time to process a given chunk
should not impact other workers processing other chunks.

##
##  Q. Why chunking?
##

The biggest reason for chunking is to reduce the overhead as in the number of
trips between workers and the main process. Hence, less IPC.

Chunking also helps enable the power-of-randomness. There's a less chance for
NFS to choke when workers acquire enough input data to last 10 ~ 15 minutes of
compute time.
