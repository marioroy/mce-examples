Various MCE demonstrations.

# Net::Pcap

  samples/             - from Net::Pcap module, t/samples/

  net_pcap_dispatch.pl - producer-consumer Net::Pcap::dispatch
  net_pcap_chunk.pl    - producer-consumer Net::Pcap::dispatch
  net_pcap_next.pl     - producer-consumer Net::Pcap::next

# Ping

  Parallel ping demonstration using MCE::Hobo and MCE::Shared.
  Based on pping.pl example included in Forks::Queue 0.03.

  inc/                 - directory containing Delay.pm module
                         for use with MCE::Shared

  ping_tcp.pl (1)      - Net::Ping (tcp)
                         32 workers, dequeues 4 at a time

  ping_syn.pl (2)      - Net::Ping (syn)
                         4 workers, dequeues 32 at a time

  ping_ae.pl           - AnyEvent::FastPing
                         4 workers, dequeues 32 at a time

  (1) Calls the system ping binary in the absence of Net::Ping.

  (2) AnyEvent::FastPing may be more reliable than Net::Ping (syn).
      For Net:Ping (syn), allow time before running again to the
      same subnet address.

  Results (time to run, for 3 out of 254 queried addresses):

      ping_tcp.pl 16.1 seconds 
      ping_syn.pl  4.7 seconds
      ping_ae.pl   4.7 seconds
